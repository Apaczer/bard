Help for Bard on MiyooCFW

Bard Storyteller is a text reader.  Bard not only allows a user to read books, but also can read books to the user using text-to-speech.

Basic Use
On the MiyooCFW, use the game controller keys or external keyboard

Y page up

B page down

A start/stop scrolling (or select in menus)

X start/stop speaking

SELECT menu of sub-screens

START return to main text screen or show info

L increase font/speed/volume

R decrease font/speed/volume

Bard can read txt, html and epub files.

Bard saves its context in a configuration file ($PWD/.bard_config) across sessions, remembering the files you are reading, the position you are at, and which voice you selected.

You can select a file to read from the File menu, press SELECT then use the d-pad to move to the File selection menu, press A to select the menu, then again use the d-pad and A to select a File/Directory to navigate to the File in your file systems.  It will remember that directory for future File selections.

Bard uses CMU's Flite Speech Synthesizer System to render the text as speech.  Three core voices are included: slt (US female), rms (US male) and awb.  The default voice, kal, using an older technology, is also available.
